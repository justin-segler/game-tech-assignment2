|  The Racket Game - Final Project Update |
-------------------------------------------

We managed to finish our game on time. We had quite a few unexpected road blocks. Ben was out of commission for a day or two because of an emergency medical situation. This put us behind on our milestone 2 update. From here, we worked to play catchup. Creating the GUI was relatively straight forward and took just about the amount of time we anticipated it would (although a few aspects on the main menu took a little longer and were a little more involved). The biggest challenge we faced towards the end of our project was piecing together all of what we had learned about NetManager in order to make our game multiplayer. This took many more hours than anticipated and we hit very small but costly snags along the way. The largest and most unanticipated roadblock that we hit was on the last day. We were not communicating physics over the network because the design of our game did not require us to for multiplayer; however, after some last minute examination of the requirements of the project, we realized that communicating physics over the network was essential. So on the last day we had to completely redesign the multiplayer version of our project to account for this. Rather than having two separate games where two users compete to get the highest score in 60 seconds (a game that would not require any transfer of physics information over the network), we redesigned the game to be collaborative: two players join the same game and work together in order to hit as many targets as possible within the alotted 60 seconds. Having to restructure our project put us way behind and created a challenge for us in and of itself. 

Another tweak that we ended up making to our main menu was the requirement of the IP address to be submitted in order to join a hosted multiplayer game. This was the best way we found to be able to join multiplayer games (especially with the time crunch that we were presented with on the final day with having to completely redesign the multiplayer version of our game). This was a challenge and required some tweaking in order to get it configured properly.
